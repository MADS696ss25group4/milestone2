## About the project
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the number of housing units at the county level along a stormâ€™s path that will experience severe damage after a hurricane.  Hurricanes are the most damaging natural disasters that frequently occur in the United States.  Delayed and inadequately resourced responses put people at risk, increase time for a community to recover, and cause major political fallout.    Developing the ability to predict severe damage can help with disaster planning and response.  For instance, if many homes are in danger of severe damage, the Red Cross can arrange for more shelter space and supplies.  HUD can conduct analysis on how many temporary vouchers they may need to issue.  FEMA can anticipate the additional supplies or resources that may be needed at the state level, and can issue mission assignments more effectively during response operations.  With better predictions, the entire emergency management community can more effectively help people during their greatest time of need.

## About the project files
All necessary data files and notebooks are included. Running them in order would require the following progression:
1. Census_Data_Final
2. Hurricane_Data_Final
3. FEMA_Data_M2
4. fema_census_hur_merge
5. ClosestPass
6. CensusClusterData
7. Maps
8. Supervised_Models_RFR_final

Most of the data files necessary for running all notebooks are included in this repo. For those that are missing:

* The US County shape files used in Maps.ipynb is available [here](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2024/COUNTY/tl_2024_us_county.zip)
* The 10Gb full Individuals and Households Program - Valid Registrations file, used in the fema_registrations_aggregate_attempt notebook, is availble [here](https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/individuals-and-households-program-valid-registrations-v2)
